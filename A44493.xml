            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <lg>
               <l n="1">1. REader, If thou do'ſt look, into this Book</l>
               <l>For wit, and for high ſtrains, Thou'lt looſe thy pains.</l>
               <l n="2">2. It was not my intent, ſtrains to invent,</l>
               <l>Or witty phraſes which ſome men count rich.</l>
               <l n="3">3. 'Twas not thy luſt to feed, while thou doſt read,</l>
               <l>Nor yet to ſatisfie a vain fancy.</l>
               <l n="4">4. But 'twas thy Soul to win, from vice, and ſin,</l>
               <l>And woo thee unto Bliſs, that I writ this.</l>
               <l n="5">5. The mind and fancy have their luſt, and crave</l>
               <l>Food for their pleaſure too, which may undo.</l>
               <l n="6">6. But here they will not find, their ſails with wind</l>
               <l>To fill; I do not ride in ſtate and pride.</l>
               <l n="7">7. My wit runs plain and ſmooth, yet doth not ſooth,</l>
               <l>Nor lull thy Soul a ſleep, to fall ith' deep.</l>
               <l n="8">8. I do not ſoar, or fly up loftily,</l>
               <l>In words and phraſes where all Stars appear.</l>
               <l n="9">9. I go low near the ground, both ſure and ſound;</l>
               <l>My lines are not too heady, but ſquare and ſtedy.</l>
               <l n="10">10. The matter which I write, doth want no height,</l>
               <l>But mounts up very high, 'bove Stars and Sky.</l>
               <l n="11">11. It opens Heaven to thee, where thou mayſt ſee,</l>
               <l>Such excellencies as mans wit do paſs.</l>
               <l n="12">12. It treats of his high love, who's from above,</l>
               <l>And who above is gone, and's on the Throne.</l>
               <l n="13">13. Yet by the way doth tell, the woes of Hell,</l>
               <l>And warns thee for to keep, from that ſad deep.</l>
               <l n="14">14. It ſhews the lovely face, and glorious grace,</l>
               <l>Of Heavens high heir in part, to take thy heart.</l>
               <l n="15">15. Though who can him declare, He is ſo fair?</l>
               <l>No pencel can ſet forth his wondrous worth.</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:44243:7"/>
               <l n="16">16. Theſe great things to expreſs, I ſought no dreſs</l>
               <l>Of flaunting eloquence, nor great expence</l>
               <l n="17">17. Of wit and art: for they cannot diſplay</l>
               <l>Their glory more but hide, their native pride.</l>
               <l n="18">18. Is not his labour loſt, and all his coſt,</l>
               <l>Who would the Sun make fine, and gild its ſhine?</l>
               <l n="19">19. The fineſt cloth of Gold that may be ſold,</l>
               <l>Yea Pearls and Diamonds ſure would it obſcure.</l>
               <l n="20">20. Rich lines, with rich wits ſuits, ſuch tree ſuch fruits,</l>
               <l>Such as I have I give, read well and live.</l>

            <head>An Apology for writing the following Poem in Verſe, and at ſuch a time as wherein I left my living, it being writ in <hi>Anno 1662.</hi> after <hi>Auguſt 24.</hi> therein.</head>

                  <l>What's hear! (thou'lt ſay) A Preacher turn'd a Poet,</l>
                  <l>A marry'd man in's Elder days to woo it?</l>
                  <l>What doth He dote? Is this a time for him,</l>
                  <l>When He hath loſt his Living to go rime.</l>
                  <l>As if He was well ſatisfi'd and pleas'd,</l>
                  <l>That He of Fourſcore pounds by th' year is eas'd?</l>
                  <l>Alas! He is not for a Poem fit,</l>
                  <l>His ſcull's too thick, He wants both Art and Wit.</l>
                  <l>What can this Babler ſay! can ought proceed</l>
                  <l>From him that worthy is that we it read?</l>
                  <l>To this I ſomething briefly anſwer ſhall,</l>
                  <l>And then commit it to thy peruſal.</l>

            </q>
            <lg>
               <l>TO Poetry I do not much pretend,</l>
               <l>Though at that time I found my Genius bend</l>
               <l>Somewhat thereto when this I wrote: my skill</l>
               <l>Is ſmall, having but little dipt my quill</l>
               <l>In thoſe ſtill waters, which do qualify</l>
               <l>The ſoul best for the Art of Poetry.</l>
               <l>Yet to my inclination at that time,</l>
               <l>A little I gave way to write in rime;</l>
               <l>I ſcarcely can tell why, but I did find</l>
               <l>That ſort of Spirit, or Muſe to court my mind.</l>
               <l>To which it having ſometimes by the by,</l>
               <l>Yielded it ſelf a little amorouſly,</l>
               <l>And yet divinely too; at length it fell</l>
               <l>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this ſubject, wherewith it did ſwell;</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:44243:8"/>
               <l>Till far beyond what I did first intend,</l>
               <l>It did this large production here forth ſend.</l>
               <l>Wherein that happ'ned to me, which ſometime</l>
               <l>Befals young mayds or women in their prime:</l>
               <l>Who while they tick and toy, and to young men</l>
               <l>(Perhaps their lovers) they do now and then</l>
               <l>Yield up themſelves after a wanton ſort,</l>
               <l>To taſte the pleaſures of the Nuptial ſport;</l>
               <l>Not thinking or deſiring (although wild)</l>
               <l>Thence to conceive, and to bring forth a child.</l>
               <l>Yet after ſometimes ſcaping (which doth make</l>
               <l>Them bolder of thoſe pleaſures to partake)</l>
               <l>Before they are aware they 're oft deceived,</l>
               <l>Begin to ſwell, and find they have conceiv'd.</l>
               <l>Even ſo it far'd with me (ſaving that I</l>
               <l>In my attempts did act more honeſtly,</l>
               <l>And therefore not aſham'd of what I did,</l>
               <l>I have not ſought to keep its product hid;</l>
               <l>As is their wont, who acting ſinfully</l>
               <l>Are fill'd with ſhame, and therefore ſeek to fly</l>
               <l>From peoples knowledge of it) but while to</l>
               <l>That Spirit which my mind ſometime did woo,</l>
               <l>I ſomewhat pleaſingly my ſelf inclin'd,</l>
               <l>It did inſinuate into my mind.</l>
               <l>That though I thought but only by the by,</l>
               <l>To exerciſe my wit, yet ſodainly</l>
               <l>I felt my ſelf to ſwell, grow big and ſick</l>
               <l>Of my conceptions; that I ſee I quick</l>
               <l>Was prov'd before I thought ſo, and perceived</l>
               <l>That ſomething from that Spirit I had received,</l>
               <l>That had the nature of an heavenly ſeed,</l>
               <l>And this ſame <hi>Embrio</hi> in my mind did breed.</l>
               <l>Which as it dropt into my mind in verſe,</l>
               <l>So I in meeter do it here rehearſe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>A way which holy men have ſometime took,</l>
               <l>As may be ſhewed from Gods holy Book:</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:44243:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <l>They holy things conceiv'd and pend in ſong,</l>
               <l>Which their ſweet ſingers did ſing, among</l>
               <l>The people at their ſolemn meetings oft,</l>
               <l>As in the Book of <hi>Chronicles</hi> we 're taught.</l>
               <l>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto the pure all things be pure; and they</l>
               <l>May any gift of God uſe, any way</l>
               <l>May take, he leads them to, thereby to draw</l>
               <l>Themſelves and others more to mind his law.</l>
               <l>And this of verſe doth ſome men more delight,</l>
               <l>Then if the ſame in proſe peruſe they might.</l>
               <l>For I conceive that ſomething there is found,</l>
               <l>In most mens minds that doth of muſick ſound:</l>
               <l>That its much wrought on by, and ſuiteth best</l>
               <l>With what in meaſur'd numbers is exprest.</l>
               <l>And ſome where we are willed to our King,</l>
               <l>Not only praiſe, but skilful praiſe to ſing.</l>
               <l>The holy Spirit of Wiſdom judges it,</l>
               <l>A practiſe alſo for him not unfit;</l>
               <l>To condeſcend to men in any ways,</l>
               <l>Whereby He them from Earth to Heaven may raiſe.</l>
               <l>And leads his ſervants to be All to any,</l>
               <l>That they thereby may unto God win many.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>That I ſhould go a wooing now may be,</l>
               <l>Perhaps an unbeſeeming thing for me.</l>
               <l>Except it be in that more doleful ſenſe,</l>
               <l>So as men do when they uſe penitence.</l>
               <l>But if it be well minded, for to woo</l>
               <l>In the more pleaſant ſenſe agrees well too</l>
               <l>With my profeſſion, for what other is</l>
               <l>A Preacher, who doth Christ ſet forth with his</l>
               <l>Excellencies, and men to him do call;</l>
               <l>But ſuch a wooer! and ſuch wooers all</l>
               <l>Right Preachers be, what elſe have I been doing,</l>
               <l>All the time I have Preacht but been ſo wooing?</l>
               <l>If any thing beſide almost, a miſs</l>
               <l>I did, which matter of Repentance is:</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:44243:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <l>Which I am ſorry for, that I have not</l>
               <l>So lov'd the Bridegroom as I ought; nor got</l>
               <l>So many Souls to him eſpouſed, as</l>
               <l>I might have done, ſince I a Preacher was.</l>
               <l>For my neglects wherein, He juſtly may</l>
               <l>Have ord'red to me as at this day;</l>
               <l>That ſuch things were impos'd by thoſe on High,</l>
               <l>As did occaſion my laying by:</l>
               <l>Wherein his goodneſs too I do adore,</l>

               <l>My loſs of honour, or eſtate, or ought</l>
               <l>That of advancement my Church living brought.</l>
               <l>Oh that my heart to him were more upright,</l>
               <l>So as in him to take my whole delight.</l>
               <l>And more to give my ſelf to do his will,</l>
               <l>And as I may my miniſtry fulfil:</l>
               <l>Truſting him with my ſelf, to do with Me</l>
               <l>Whatever pleaſing unto him ſhall be.</l>
               <l>While I his work do, obey his command,</l>
               <l>He can me ſave, becauſe He in his hand</l>

               <l>However let his will be done for it</l>
               <l>Is good, and to it I ſubmit.</l>

               <l>To be amiſs, in manner, or in matter,</l>
               <l>For I do not my ſelf ſo vainly flatter;</l>
               <l>As to conceive I ſo divinely write,</l>
               <l>As nothing may be therein but whats right,</l>
               <l>Or at the least, that as it came from me,</l>

               <l>That I his glorious perſon perſonate,</l>

               <l>Or repreſent the juſt's melodious ſongs,</l>
               <l>And great rejoycings; when on ſentence past,</l>
               <l>They ſhall poſſeſs thoſe dooms that ay ſhall last.</l>
               <l>Therein I pardon crave, if any thing</l>
               <l>There's therein found, that is unbefilting</l>
               <l>His greatneſs, or their glory; what I writ</l>
               <l>Therein, was for my exerciſe; as fit</l>
               <l>I did conceive thoſe things that are to come,</l>

               <l>Endeavouring to expreſs them, as may well</l>
               <l>Conſist with what thereof the Scriptures tell:</l>
               <l>And unto others ſo them to preſent,</l>
               <l>As might them best awaken to repent.</l>
               <l>And that ſuch as are just may ſtill be ſo,</l>
               <l>And never may the ways of truth forgo.</l>
               <l>And much refreſhing it unto me brought,</l>
               <l>While I unto thoſe things, my mind and thought</l>
               <l>Did exerciſe; nor hath there any time</l>
               <l>Befallen me, wherein to verſe and rime</l>
               <l>I found my ſelf diſpoſed more; for though I</l>
               <l>My Living parted with then, yet thereby</l>
               <l>My Conſcience I kept free, from what would</l>
               <l>Have more diſturb'd my mind, had I made bold</l>

               <l>Though I more elbow room, might amongſt men</l>
               <l>Have had, and ſome more money in my purſe;</l>
               <l>Yet I was fearful that my ſoul, much worſe</l>

               <l>That I for living ſake did that profeſs,</l>
               <l>Which I conceived not to be blameleſs.</l>
               <l>Not that I do condemn, what they above</l>

            <head>A Commendatory Epiſtle to the Reader.</head>
            <byline>Written by a lover of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend</hi> and <hi>Judicious Author</hi> of this BOOK.</byline>
            <lg>
               <l>ALthought this Poem doth not ſtand in need</l>
               <l>Of my poor Commendations: which indeed</l>
               <l>Are of ſmall value, ſince I am, and ſeem</l>
               <l>One of ſo little Learning or Eſteem,</l>
               <l>That ſmall regard, or credit, given will be,</l>
               <l>To ought that is expreſſed here by me.</l>
               <l>Touching his Book, which is not Mean, nor Weak,</l>
               <l>But fully able, for it ſelf to Speak,</l>
               <l>And to command Reſpect, in ſpight of them,</l>
               <l>That ſhall the ſame through prejudice contemn:</l>
               <l>Yea, to convince, or put to ſilence, Thoſe</l>
               <l>Who ſhall preſume, or dare it to oppoſe:</l>
               <l>All which might be as Reaſons, why I ſhould</l>
               <l>My hand and pen from this employment hold.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yet notwithſtanding, when I did peruſe</l>
               <l>That Heavenly Dialogue, which here enſues</l>
               <l>And is the ſubject of this following Tract,</l>
               <l>Obſerving too, how well it was compact</l>
               <l>And firmly built upon God's Holy Word,</l>
               <l>With which the ſubſtance of it doth accord:</l>
               <l>Giving the Reader much good help and light,</l>
               <l>The Scriptures for to underſtand aright,</l>
               <l>In thoſe moſt weighty and important things,</l>
               <l>Which to the Soul, moſt good and profit brings;</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:44243:12"/>
               <l>Clearing away thoſe Fogs and Miſts which riſe,</l>
               <l>To cloud and hide Chriſt's beauty from our Eyes;</l>
               <l>Whoſe kindneſs, goodneſs, love, and lovelineſs,</l>
               <l>Incomparably he doth here expreſs;</l>
               <l>And his good-will to us ſo far imparts,</l>
               <l>As well might make our hard and frozen hearts</l>
               <l>Melt into Tears; and willingly embrace</l>
               <l>Our dear Redeemer's proffered love and grace,</l>
               <l>Which is moſt rich, and free, as doth appear,</l>
               <l>And is as richly repreſented here.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I alſo heeding how induſtriouſly</l>
               <l>He labour's and indeavour's to unty,</l>
               <l>And break thoſe ſnares the World, and Devil makes</l>
               <l>To hold us Pris'ners; and what pains he takes</l>
               <l>To ſet us free: and earneſtly doth ſtrive</l>
               <l>Our much deluded Soul's to undeceive;</l>
               <l>And alſo with what Scriptural replies</l>
               <l>He anſwers all thoſe Reas'nings, which ariſe</l>
               <l>In our vain carnal Atheiſtick heart;</l>
               <l>As cauſes why we are ſo loth to part</l>
               <l>With our falſe lovers, and our ſelves betake</l>
               <l>To Chriſt, who only can us happy make:</l>
               <l>Declaring how abſurd, and reaſonleſs</l>
               <l>It is for men to ſeek their happineſs,</l>
               <l>In ways which do ſo much debaſe the Soul,</l>
               <l>Namely, to live as Beaſts without controule,</l>
               <l>Only to feed their ſenſual appetites,</l>
               <l>With worldly, ſenſual, periſhing delights.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And how he by plain reaſon, overthrows</l>
               <l>The Atheiſtick Principles of thoſe</l>
               <l>Vain, fooliſh Worldlings, who in heart deny</l>
               <l>The Power, and Providence of the Moſt High,</l>
               <l>Who Made and Rules the World, and will likewiſe</l>
               <l>Moſt certainly cauſe all the Dead to Riſe,</l>
               <l>And come to Judgment. At that dreadful Day,</l>
               <l>When Chriſt moſt infinitely will repay</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:44243:12"/>
               <l>His friends, and foes, far otherwiſe then here</l>
               <l>They ever in this World repayed were.</l>
               <l>A glimpſe of which Reward and Puniſhment,</l>
               <l>He doth beforehand lively here preſent:</l>
               <l>Shewing what dreadful Horror ſhall ſurprize,</l>
               <l>All who to Chriſt, and his, are Enemies:</l>
               <l>And have them Perſecuted, ſcorn'd, or ſlighted.</l>
               <l>How ſuch ſhall ſtand amazed and affrighted,</l>
               <l>At that ſtrange turn, and (though 't will nought avail)</l>
               <l>Their former fooliſh, ſinful ways bewail;</l>
               <l>And with moſt bitter lamentations, rue</l>
               <l>That they, their luſts and pleaſures to purſue,</l>
               <l>Should God neglect: and what might have prevented</l>
               <l>Their being ſo unſpeakably Tormented.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And how the Saints in their moſt bleſſed ſtate,</l>
               <l>Their dear Redeemer's praiſe ſhall celebrate,</l>
               <l>With Songs of Tryumph, reigning gloriouſly,</l>
               <l>As Kings with Him, to all Eternity.</l>
               <l>And then from both doth ſtrongly reinforce</l>
               <l>His former ſuit, that we would take the courſe</l>
               <l>Which he perſwades; namely, with Chriſt to cloſe</l>
               <l>Unfainedly; not fearing wants or foes.</l>
               <l>Which fears and doubtings, in us to prevent,</l>
               <l>Chriſt to us he again doth repreſent,</l>
               <l>As all-ſufficient to preſerve and guide us,</l>
               <l>And all things neceſſary to provide us.</l>
               <l>Shewing Chriſt's tender love, and ſpecial care,</l>
               <l>Which he for all his Servants will declare;</l>
               <l>That they ſhall have no reaſon to repent</l>
               <l>Their choice; and then gives great incouragement</l>
               <l>That though we many ſtrong corruptions have,</l>
               <l>Chriſt's grace ſhall us from thoſe corruptions ſave;</l>
               <l>That we o're them, through him, ſhall conqueſt get,</l>
               <l>And alſo over whatſoever let,</l>
               <l>May interpoſe: And that the only thing</l>
               <l>Which Chriſt deſires is, that we be willing</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:44243:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <l>To give our ſelves wholly to him, and then</l>
               <l>He will give back himſelf to us agen;</l>
               <l>And with himſelf whatever good thing he</l>
               <l>Shall needful for our ſouls and bodies ſee,</l>
               <l>This and much more (our hearts for to allure)</l>

            <head>On the foregoing Commendations of the following Poem.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>OThers affect that by ſome Learned men,</l>
               <l>Some Doctors, Students, Preachers, or the pen</l>
               <l>Of ſome great Perſon, what they put to Preſs</l>
               <l>Should be commended; or delight to dreſs</l>
               <l>It with ſome curious Frontiſpeice: my mind</l>
               <l>In good men's approbation more doth find</l>
               <l>It to content; that ſuch as God believe,</l>
               <l>And his inſtructions likewell to receive</l>
               <l>Who godlineſs endeavour after, fleeing</l>
               <l>What ever things are therewith diſagreeing,</l>
               <l>Commend my ſtudies and endeavours: for</l>
               <l>Such Perſons praiſes God doth not abhor.</l>
               <l>By ſuch he'll be commended, when by thoſe</l>
               <l>Who to true godlineſs are real foes:</l>
               <pb facs="tcp:44243:15"/>
               <l>(Though great, and rich, and learned too they be)</l>
               <l>To be extolled, much diſdaineth he.</l>
               <l>Nor did that Kingly Poet <hi>David,</hi> whoſe</l>
               <l>Praiſes were great in ſongs, who did compoſe</l>
               <l>The ſweeteſt Poems, unto him invite</l>
               <l>The great or Learned Perſons, that they might</l>
               <l>Turn in to him and his Companions be;</l>
               <l>But ſuch as fear'd the Lord, thereto did he</l>
               <l>Invite and call: they in God's myſteries</l>
               <l>Have the beſt judgment, are the truly wiſe.</l>
               <l>Nor God nor good men for their poverty</l>
               <l>Do any ſuch deſpiſe, why then ſhould I?</l>
               <l>Better by one poor good man prais'd to be,</l>
               <l>Than by a thouſand bad of high degree.</l>
               <l>In ſuch (though mean men in this World) God's treaſures</l>
               <l>Have oft been put, and they of divine pleaſures</l>
               <l>Have oft the largeſt deepeſt draughts; the Saints</l>
               <l>Or holy men (what ever outward wants</l>
               <l>Have them attended) Chriſt's inheritance</l>
               <l>With all its glorious riches doth advance.</l>
               <l>If ſuch then like my works, if what I've pen'd</l>
               <l>Thoſe that be truly pious do commend,</l>
               <l>It is enough; if they be pleas'd, I much</l>
               <l>Paſs not for their accounts that are not ſuch.</l>
               <l>Though that's the lot of goodneſs too, that oft</l>
               <l>Some ſuch it praiſe too, who themſelves are naught.</l>
               <l>Such virtu's beauty that it oft attracts,</l>
               <l>Their eyes and tongues, who yet refuſe its acts.</l>
               <l>Who loving ſenſual pleaſures, can't endure</l>
               <l>Themſelves unto thoſe labours to inure</l>
               <l>Whence thoſe good fruits are reap't, which who ſo taſte,</l>
               <l>Shall joys injoy which evermore ſhall laſt.</l>
               <l>Such forcedly, though th' act not, praiſe what's right;</l>
               <l>But vertues foll'wers praiſe her with delight.</l>

               <l>What worſhip God requires of praiſe and pray'r,</l>

               <l>As if ſome Bibles did not ſhew the way,</l>

               <l>Likely thoſe Form's of Pray'r you meant thereby,</l>

               <l>If ſo, pray know, that I the words of them</l>
               <l>Do not except againſt, much leſs condemn.</l>

               <l>Unto the pure all things are pure and good,</l>

               <l>For what I am not ſatisfied in,</l>

               <l>I can't well tell, nor much inquire it ſhall.</l>
               <l>I call them not my Service, they that do</l>
